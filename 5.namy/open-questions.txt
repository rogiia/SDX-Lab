a) The second time, the resolver finds the server name in the cache but, since
TTL time is 0, and so the entry is removed and we still need to scale to the
root server.
b) When a host fails, we can still resolve its name but when we ping it, we
receive no response.
c) Now, when the host stops, the resolver responds to the client 'unknown
host'.
d) After the host has restarted and registered itself, the client is unable to
find it because it hits a cache which points to a process that is no longer
running.
e) Cached information in the resolver keeps pointing to old hosts even if
they are no longer running.
f) The only nodes which know about the host movement is the server to which the
host registers itself.
g) The client will be able to query the host correctly after the TTL has
expired, so the result of the query will be invalid and the request will be
escalated again to the server with the upadated host process.
h) Given D is domain server depth, F is the interval in seconds which the
client waits to make each request, R is the total duration of the client's
action and T is the TTL time. 
Without the cache:
NumM = 2D((R/F)+1)

With cache:
Given T' is the next multiple of F after T
NumM = 2D(|R/T'|+1)
