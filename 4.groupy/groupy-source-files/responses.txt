MS1) Tryng various Sleep values from 30 to 5000 milliseconds it seems that all nodes are able to keep up with the state coordination.
a) If the leader worker crashes, the remaining workers just stop changing state.
b) If the leader worker crashes, the rest of the nodes keep synchronizing their state without problems.
c) If a slave worker crashes, it will keep being in the list of slaves but if it is elected, all the other nodes will try to monitor it and will recieve a 'DOWN' message, which will restart the election without the node that failed.
MS4) Image with the state of the system after a slave and the leader crashed, the nodes keep coordinating.
